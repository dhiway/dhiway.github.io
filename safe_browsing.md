**Safe Browsing** is a service built to identify unsafe websites across the web and notify users of potential harm.

**SEQR** uses information from Google’s Safe Browsing and other online services that examines billions of URLs and content on those pages in its search for unsafe websites. The service then enables users to make informed decisions about whether or not to trust specific websites and content through real-time security warnings.

### Here’s how it works:
When you scan a QR code or verify a web link, SEQR uses the aggregated information to check if the link is SAFE or associated with spam, abuse, phishing, or other harmful activity. These unsafe sites may try to do things like stealing your credentials or install malicious software on your device! The URL itself will not be shared with any of the third-party services we use to examine the content.

For more information on phishing, malware, and other types of dangerous websites, check out [Anti-Phishing Working Group](http://www.antiphishing.org/), [StopBadware](https://www.stopbadware.org/), [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/) and [Google’s Unwanted Software Policy](https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html).

Please understand that the Safe Browsing service might not be perfect. SEQR works to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information about unsafe web resources. However, SEQR cannot guarantee that its information is comprehensive and error-free: some risky sites may not be identified, and some safe sites may be identified in error. If the information is being incorrectly categorized, please report it to help more people stay safer online.
